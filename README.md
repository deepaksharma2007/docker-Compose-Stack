# Docker Stack Deployment Example
This repository explains how to deploy a Docker Stack using Docker Swarm. Docker Stack allows you to manage multiple services as a single deployment, making it easier to orchestrate complex applications.

Docker Stack is a feature of Docker Swarm that allows you to deploy and manage multiple services (microservices) using a single command and a Docker Compose file. Itâ€™s primarily used for orchestrating applications in a cluster of Docker nodes.
In simpler terms:
- Instead of managing individual services manually, you can manage an entire application (frontend, backend, database, etc.) as a single unit.
- Docker Stack works like docker-compose, but for production environments on a Swarm cluster.
